'''Note:we can use double and single quotes alternatively as a delimiter.
The question is what if both of them used as string delimiter and value like this:print("print("double qoute in side double qoute delimiter")"
print("print("double qoute")")   SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?
to fix this we have to wrap single qoute  in side double qoute delimiter or vice versa change the " double qoute" 'double qoute'
print("print('double qoute'))")

# Line-1:The bug is because of the absence of delimiter so can be solve by adding these delimiter
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# Line-2:the output needed is to display "+"" this output could be found by adding the following
print("String Concatenation is done with the" + '"+"' + "sign.")
# Line-3:This is indentation error so deleting a space at the beginning will solve the problem
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# line-4:This is the syntax error in ( is unneccessary so we remove this
